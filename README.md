# Twitch_FAQBot
## What is it?
This chatbot combines the !dice feature in the [Twitch chatbot example](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/) with an integrated [Watson assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant?language=node) to provide responses to a variety of user inputs. 

## Why should I care?
When you're streaming, you'll have a mass of new streamers who will inevitably begin to ask the same questions to you. By defining the answers to these questions through an IBM Watson assistant, this bot can answer those questions so that you can continue to do what you love best while they are being interacted with and informed!

## How do I set it up?
The user needs only to follow the instructions to run the code locally as shown in the [Twitch chatbot example](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/) and update the credentials found from following the instructions under the prequisite section at the [IBM Watson Assistant Github Example](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-simple).
